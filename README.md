# DDD Studio

## Project Description

**DDD Studio** is a tool designed to document artifacts identified in the Domain-Driven Design Starter Modelling
Process. It helps users document key elements such as Bounded Contexts and Aggregates. The tool automatically creates a
structured set of folders and YAML documents, making it easy to document and organize your DDD artifacts. YAML is used
for its simplicity and readability, allowing both humans and machines to easily understand and edit the documents. This
structured approach facilitates continuous collaboration and integration into repositories, supporting ongoing
development efforts.
